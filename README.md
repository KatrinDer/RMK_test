# RMK_test

Rita works in RMK Tallinn office. She takes the Tallinn city bus number 8 from Zoo to Toompark (names of bus stops) to get to work. Rita has a meeting at 9:05 sharp every day from Monday to Friday. It takes her 300 seconds to walk from home to the departure bus stop and 240 seconds to walk from the destination bus stop to the meeting room. Plot the probability of Rita being late to the meeting depending on the time she leaves home. (Assuming she can only use the bus to get to work.)
